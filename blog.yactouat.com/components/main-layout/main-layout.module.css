/* 
  nextjs supports https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules by default,
  what is really cool is that class names are auto generated (kinda like view encapsulation in angular);
  this means you dont have to worry about name collisions when you use a module for a given component;
  furthermore, using CSS modules with next js means that you're code splitting your CSS code as well behind the scenes
